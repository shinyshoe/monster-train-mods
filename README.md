# monster-train-mods

A few example Monster Train mods from the dev team at Shiny Shoe.

You can get Monster Train on Steam here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/

These mods won't compile until you:
1. Copy the `MonsterTrain_Data` directory from wherever Monster Train is installed on your computer to `monster-train-mods\MonsterTrain_Data`.
2. Copy the `BepInEx` directory to `monster-train-mods\BepInEx`.  BepInEx can be found at https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.
